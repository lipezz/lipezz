# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Luiz

ðŸš€ I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer, and my expertise includes Node.js, React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript and Java development. That's what I love to do! With a strong background in backend architecture and API development, I also bring hands-on experience in production systems operations, working with tools such as GCP Apigee, Broadcom Apigateway, Unix, WebLogic, SOA, ELK, Docker and Aws.

âœ¨ I'm passionate about:
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Collaborating closely with people

Let's connect and build amazing things! ðŸš€
